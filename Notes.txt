v.next
* Fix DynamicLibraryFixup to allow for mixed cases in call by app.
* Fix for CreateFile when request is to the redirected area directly and file either exists already there or the request was to CREATE_ALWAYS.
* Fix DeleteDirectory to allow deletion of redirected directory.
* WIP: Add intercepts for many ucrtbased (POSIX) file system calls.  These only intercept, log (debug build only), and call the original function.  
  Trying to determine if some of these functions skip the kernel32 library and jump under our intercepts there.
  Ultimately conditionally compiled these out as they A) Didn't intercept for some reason. B) Were determined to not be needed.
* Added intercept for ReadDirectoryChangesW and ReadDirectoryChangesExW that only log the calls.  
	Until we find an app that requires modification, this is the next best thing.
