v.next
 * Created new Managed File Redirection Fixup (MFRFixup) as a potential replacement for FileRedirectionFixup
 * Fix issue in DynamicLibraryFixup with certain mixes of bitness.

v.2022.08.05
* Incorporate platform changes per Microsoft
* PathRedirectonV2 fix for DeVFS calculation.
* Renumber debug instance startin numbers.  FRF=0, DynLib=30k Env=40k RegLeg=50k
* Allow Copy and Rename fixups to handle empty redirected destinations and sources only in redirected area.

v.2022.07.10
* Fix DynamicLibraryFixup to allow for mixed cases in call by app.
* Fix for CreateFile when request is to the redirected area directly and file either exists already there or the request was to CREATE_ALWAYS.
* Fix DeleteDirectory to allow deletion of redirected directory (even though the package folder will still be present).
* WIP: Add intercepts for many ucrtbased (POSIX) file system calls.  
  The code is currenly defined out, and would only intercept, and log (debug build only), and call the original function if enabled.  
  This was an attempt to determine if some of these functions skip the kernel32 library and jump under our intercepts there.
  Ultimately conditionally compiled these out as they A) Didn't intercept for some reason. B) Were determined to not be needed.
* Added intercept for ReadDirectoryChangesW and ReadDirectoryChangesExW that only log the calls.  
	Until we find an app that requires modification, this is the next best thing.
